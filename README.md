#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This projects' main goal was to develop a program for high school students to learn about being fiscially responsible, specifically with investing and acurring interest.  



#What did you do particularly well?
I think I understood the assignment well and created a well organzied code.



#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I did not correctly build my code to display both reports that were asked for.  I wpuld definitley need to fix this so the code is doing everything it is supposed to.  I also need to add inline comments to this which I did not do to explain my intent behind parts of my code.



#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I often have trouble with things printing on new lines so that was a challenge for me.  I find that physical books are a good resource for me to look at when I am troubleshooting.


#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I think a skill learned from this project is to always double check my work to ensure my code is meeting all the requirements neccessary.  Making this mistake in this project has taught me that it is important to run the project and check that everything is being created.


#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Using OOP with InvestmentCalculator class helps the code easily maintainable and easy to modify if needed in the future.  I also made each method complete only one task so that it was not to complicated.
